# finalProject
## Project overview: 

**Tech to use: **
• Google Maps API [link]
• Google Maps visualization API [link]
• Typeform API

**Possible Data Sources: **
Distiller
Master of Malt

**Design Needs/Goals: **
• Responsive flow on homepage for mobile ( media query)
• Basic branding: logo, google fonts and name of service 
• Series of animationed illustrations in the learn more page ( either GIF or CSS)

** Challenges / Heads-up:**
• If I can't get an API or easy data I might have to spend some time to translate data into a usable format. And I don't know anything about spreadsheets.
• I need to figure out how time consuming the illustration concepts I have are before over committing to them.
